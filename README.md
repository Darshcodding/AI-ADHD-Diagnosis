# AI-ADHD-Diagnosis
In this Repository there will be the codes, data processing scripts, and documentation for the project "AI-Powered ADHD Diagnosis: Analyzing Motor Activity and Heart Rate Data Using Machine Learning." The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify ADHD patients based on motor activity and heart rate data.
# AI-Powered ADHD Diagnosis: Machine Learning on Motor Activity & Heart Rate Data

## ** Project Overview**
This project applies **machine learning techniques** to analyze **motor activity and heart rate data** for ADHD diagnosis. Traditional ADHD assessment methods rely on **behavioral tests and clinical interviews**, which can be subjective and time-consuming. This project aims to explore **data-driven methods** for ADHD classification using supervised learning models.

## **📊 Dataset Information**
- **Dataset Name**: [HYPERAKTIV ADHD Diagnosis Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/adhd-diagnosis-data)
- **Source**: Kaggle  
- **Description**:  
  - **51 ADHD patients** and **52 clinical control subjects**  
  - **Time-series data** on motor activity and heart rate variability  
  - **Neuropsychological test results** (CPT-II Conners Performance Test)  
  - **Demographic data** (Age, Sex, Medication Status)  

## **🎯 Project Goals**
**Clean and preprocess dataset** (handle missing values, remove outliers)  
**Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (visualizing trends in data)  
**Feature Engineering** (extract statistical & time-series features)  
**Train ML models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks)  
**Evaluate model performance** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)

## **🧠Machine Learning Approach**
**The following supervised learning models will be tested:**
**Logistic Regression**
**Random Forest**
**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
**Neural Networks (MLP)**
**Feature selection techniques will be used to optimize performance.**

## **📊 Results & Performance Metrics**
**After training the models, their performance will be assessed using:**
**Accuracy**
**Precision & Recall**
**F1-score**
**ROC-AUC Curve**
**Confusion Matrix Analysis**

## **Project Status:**
**I have just started the initial phase of this project. This is a three-month final year project, and I will update the repository with code files and progress as I start implementing the machine learning models. The repository will be regularly updated with data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation scripts over the course of the project.**
